# UWCS Challenge - Problems

An archive of programming problems used for internal society competitions. Also contains sample solutions, scripts for both generating sufficiently large input data, and scripts for marking output data.

*Recommended:*
If making changes to the LaTeX, compile the problems using TeX Live in conjunction with the LaTeX Workshop extension.
