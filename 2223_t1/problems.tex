\section*{Introduction}

Welcome to our internal progcomp!
There will be problems. There will be prizes! And of course, there will be pizza.
This document contains specifications for the 5 problems.

For each problem, you will need to process your solution on various input datasets, then submit the outputs (and your code) for scoring.
This is all handled by our website:
\begin{center}
    \huge \href{https://challenge.uwcs.co.uk}{challenge.uwcs.co.uk}
\end{center}

There are 100 (+25) points available for each problem. 
The base 100 points are divided across each input file. 
For example - if there are 5 input files, each is worth up to 20 points. 
Each input file has multiple test cases, so you can get partial marks.
Fully complete a problem and get a bonus 25 points - a nice incentive for finishing it off!

Later problems may be score-based, so won't have a designated solution.
For these, points are awarded by ranking teams on their score for each input dataset, and scaling that from 0 to 100.
To be ranked, your score must be non-negative.

The first 3 problems will be released simultaneously.
The rest will be staggered. \\ 
Good luck, and have fun!
